5. Use /commit-and-pr workflow
6. Get code review
7. Merge! 🎉
```

**Result:** Contributing in hours, not weeks!

## 💡 Team Development Workflow

### Daily Flow

**Morning:**
```bash
git pull origin main
# Check assigned issues
# Join standup
```

**Building Features:**
```
Ask Cascade: "Build [feature] following our architecture"

# Cascade uses team Memories:
- Follows team patterns
- Uses conventions
- Generates consistent code
```

**Before PR:**
```bash
/code-review-assistant      # Quality check
/run-tests-and-fix         # Tests
/security-scan             # Security
/commit-and-pr             # Create PR
```

**After PR:**
- Post in Slack
- Request reviewers
- Respond to feedback
- Use /address-pr-comments
