## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install Arsenals

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisTansey007/arsenal-integration-hub/main/scripts/install-all.sh | bash
```

### Step 2: Create Project

```bash
~/arsenals/arsenal-integration-hub/scripts/setup-project.sh my-project minimal
cd my-project
```

### Step 3: Add Essential Files

```bash
# Copy just what you need
cp ~/arsenals/windsurf-memories-arsenal/project-types/[your-stack]-memory.md \
   .windsurf/memories/

cp ~/arsenals/ai-workflows-arsenal/windsurf/development/run-tests-and-fix.md \
   .windsurf/workflows/

cp ~/arsenals/ai-workflows-arsenal/windsurf/development/code-review-assistant.md \
   .windsurf/workflows/
```

### Step 4: Start Coding

```bash
windsurf .
# Arsenal is ready! Start building.
```

## 📦 Recommended Minimal Setup

### Essential Files (3-5 total)

```
.windsurf/
├── memories/
│   └── project-memory.md          # Your project context
├── rules/
│   └── (optional - skip for minimal)
└── workflows/
    ├── run-tests-and-fix.md       # Auto-fix tests
    ├── code-review-assistant.md   # Pre-review
    └── commit-and-pr.md            # Clean commits
```

**Why minimal?**
- Less overwhelming
- Faster to customize
- Easier to maintain
- Just what you need

## 💭 Your Project Memory (Template)

Create `.windsurf/memories/project-memory.md`:

```markdown
# My Project Memory

## What I'm Building

[Brief description of your project]

## Tech Stack

- [Framework]: [e.g., Next.js 14]
- [Language]: [e.g., TypeScript]
- [Database]: [e.g., PostgreSQL]
- [Styling]: [e.g., Tailwind CSS]

## Project Structure

\`\`\`
/app         - [Description]
/components  - [Description]
/lib         - [Description]
\`\`\`

## My Preferences

### Code Style
- [Preference 1]
- [Preference 2]

### Patterns I Like
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

### Things to Avoid
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]

## Current Focus

[What you're working on right now]

## Notes

[Any other context Cascade should know]
```

**Customize this as your project grows!**

## 🚀 Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Open Windsurf
windsurf .

# 3. Check what to build today
# (Your TODO, GitHub issues, etc.)
```

### Building Features

```
# In Cascade:
"Build a [feature] with [requirements]"

# Cascade generates code using your Memory context
# Tests automatically included
# Follows your style preferences
```

### Before Committing

```bash
# Quick quality check
/code-review-assistant

# Ensure tests pass
/run-tests-and-fix

# Clean commit
/commit-and-pr
```

### End of Day

```bash
# Push your work
git push

# That's it!
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Solo Devs

### 1. Keep Memory Updated

As your project evolves, update your Memory:

```markdown
## Recent Decisions

- 2025-01-20: Decided to use Zustand for state
- 2025-01-18: Switched to App Router
- 2025-01-15: Added tRPC for type-safe API
```

Cascade remembers these decisions!

### 2. Use Workflows Liberally

Don't manually do repetitive tasks:

```bash
# Instead of manually testing
/run-tests-and-fix

# Instead of manual review
/code-review-assistant

# Instead of writing commit messages
/commit-and-pr
```

### 3. Gradually Add More

Start minimal, add as needed:

```
Week 1: Just 1 Memory
Week 2: Add run-tests workflow
Week 3: Add code review workflow
Week 4: Add 1 Rule for your framework
```

### 4. Document Decisions in Memory

When you make an architectural decision:

```markdown
## Why I Chose X Over Y

**Decision:** Using React Server Components
**Reason:** Better performance, simpler data fetching
**Date:** 2025-01-18
```

Cascade will follow this logic!

### 5. Use Prompts from Arsenal

Browse [prompt-arsenal](https://github.com/ChrisTansey007/prompt-arsenal) for pre-written prompts:

```
"Using the full-stack-setup prompt:
Set up Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Prisma"
```

## 🔧 Customization Ideas

### Add Your Snippets

Create `.windsurf/memories/my-snippets.md`:

```markdown
# My Code Snippets

## API Fetch Pattern

\`\`\`typescript
async function fetchData<T>(url: string): Promise<T> {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Fetch failed');
  return res.json();
}
\`\`\`

## Error Boundary

\`\`\`typescript
// My standard error boundary pattern
\`\`\`
```

Cascade will use these patterns!

### Add Project Goals

```markdown
## Project Goals

- Launch MVP by: March 1, 2025
- Target users: Freelance developers
- Key feature: Automated invoicing
- Tech focus: Fast, simple, reliable

## Non-Goals

- Not building mobile app (yet)
- Not supporting enterprise (yet)
```

Cascade prioritizes accordingly!

## 🎯 When to Add More

### Start Adding Rules When:
- Project gets complex
- Want stricter conventions
- Team might join later

### Start Adding More Memories When:
- Multiple services/modules
- Complex architecture decisions
- Want more detailed context

### Keep It Minimal When:
- Prototype/POC
- Learning new tech
- Quick projects
- Simple apps

---

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Is minimal setup enough?**  
A: Yes! Most solo projects thrive with just 1 Memory and 2-3 Workflows.

**Q: When should I add more?**  
A: When you feel the need. Start minimal, grow as needed.

**Q: Can I use this for client work?**  
A: Absolutely! Professional results with minimal setup.

**Q: What if I work with a team later?**  
A: Easy to expand. Add team Memories and Rules gradually.

**Q: How do I backup my configuration?**  
A: `.windsurf/` is in your git repo. It's backed up automatically!
