# 📦 Repository Organization - Complete Example

**Transform scattered files into organized structure with 80% reduction in search time.**

---

## 🎯 What This Example Shows

This example demonstrates how to use **3 Arsenal items together** to organize a messy repository:

1. **🔄 Workflow** - `repo-organize-files.md` (3-phase process)
2. **⚙️ Rule** - `repo-org-principles.md` (7 core principles)
3. **🤖 Script** - `migrate-files-safe.ps1` (automated migration)

**Result:** Clean, maintainable repository structure in 2-3 hours.

---

## 📋 The Problem

Your repository has:
- ❌ 50+ files scattered in root directory
- ❌ Documents spread across `/docs`, `/documentation`, root
- ❌ Scripts in root, `/scripts`, `/tools`, `/bin`
- ❌ Team takes 5-10 minutes to find specific files
- ❌ New developers spend 2+ hours understanding structure
- ❌ "Where does this file go?" questions daily

**Sound familiar?** This example is for you!

## 🚀 Quick Start (15 minutes)

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install all Arsenal repos
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisTansey007/arsenal-integration-hub/main/scripts/install-all.sh | bash

# Or manual installation
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTansey007/windsurf-memories-arsenal.git ~/arsenals/windsurf-memories-arsenal
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTansey007/ai-rules-arsenal.git ~/arsenals/ai-rules-arsenal
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTansey007/ai-workflows-arsenal.git ~/arsenals/ai-workflows-arsenal
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTansey007/ai-scripts-arsenal.git ~/arsenals/ai-scripts-arsenal
```

### Step 1: Copy Arsenal Items (2 min)

```bash
# Navigate to your messy repository
cd /path/to/your-repo

# Create Arsenal directories
mkdir -p .windsurf/workflows .windsurf/rules scripts/migration

# Copy the workflow
cp ~/arsenals/ai-workflows-arsenal/windsurf/project-organization/repo-organize-files.md \
   .windsurf/workflows/

# Copy the rule
cp ~/arsenals/ai-rules-arsenal/windsurf/organization/repo-org-principles.md \
   .windsurf/rules/

# Copy the script
cp ~/arsenals/ai-scripts-arsenal/scripts/repository-management/migrate-files/migrate-files-safe.ps1 \
   scripts/migration/
```

### Step 2: Follow the Workflow (2-3 hours)

Open the workflow in Windsurf:

```bash
# In Windsurf/Cascade
/repo-organize-files
```

**The workflow guides you through:**

**Phase 1: ANALYZE (1-2 hours)**
- Inventory current files
- Identify patterns
- Design category system
- Document decisions

**Phase 2: AUTOMATE (30-60 min)**
- Customize migration script
- Add your file mappings
- Test with dry-run

**Phase 3: EXECUTE (30 min)**
- Review with team
- Execute migration
- Verify results
- Update imports
- Commit changes

### Step 3: Verify Success (10 min)

```bash
# Check structure
tree -L 2 docs/
tree -L 2 scripts/

# Look for orphaned files
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f

# Test application
npm start  # or your start command

# Commit if all works
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: reorganize repository structure"
git push
```

---

## 📖 Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design

#### 1.1 Inventory Current State

```bash
# Count total files
find . -type f | wc -l

# Files in root
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l

# Show structure
tree -L 2
```

**Document findings:**
```
Current State:
- Total files: 247
- Files in root: 52
- Subdirectories: 8 (docs, scripts, tools, bin, old, backup, tmp, lib)
- Pain: Can't find deployment scripts (scattered across 3 folders)
```

#### 1.2 Identify Categories

**Ask these questions:**
1. What are the main purposes? (startup, development, testing, deployment, docs)
2. What's the natural workflow order?
3. What categories would make sense to your team?

**Design your structure:**
```
docs/
├── 00-CURRENT/     # Active working documents
├── 01-GUIDES/      # How-to guides
├── 02-TECHNICAL/   # API docs, architecture
├── 03-RUNBOOKS/    # Operations procedures
└── 05-ARCHIVE/     # Historical reference

scripts/
├── 00-STARTUP/     # Initialization scripts
├── 01-DEVELOPMENT/ # Dev tools
├── 02-DATABASE/    # Migrations, seeds
├── 03-TESTING/     # Test runners
├── 04-BUILD/       # Build scripts
├── 05-DEPLOYMENT/  # Deploy automation
├── 06-OPERATIONS/  # Monitoring, logs
└── 07-UTILITIES/   # General tools
```

#### 1.3 Get Team Buy-In

Share design with team:
```markdown
## Proposed Structure

### Goals
- Reduce search time by 80%
- Make onboarding easier
- Clear where new files belong

### Categories
[Show your design]

### Questions
- Does this match our mental model?
- Any categories missing?
- Names clear enough?
```

---

### Phase 2: Automation

#### 2.1 Customize Migration Script

Edit `scripts/migration/migrate-files-safe.ps1`:

```powershell
# Your actual file mappings
Move-File "README.md" "docs/00-CURRENT/README.md" "Main project docs"
Move-File "SETUP.md" "docs/01-GUIDES/SETUP.md" "Setup instructions"
Move-File "API.md" "docs/02-TECHNICAL/API.md" "API documentation"

Move-File "start.ps1" "scripts/00-STARTUP/start.ps1" "Main startup"
Move-File "dev-server.ps1" "scripts/01-DEVELOPMENT/dev-server.ps1" "Dev server"
Move-File "test-all.ps1" "scripts/03-TESTING/test-all.ps1" "Test runner"
Move-File "deploy.ps1" "scripts/05-DEPLOYMENT/deploy.ps1" "Deploy to prod"

# Add all your files...
```

**Tips:**
- Start with most important files
- Document purpose for each
- Group related files together
- Use consistent naming

#### 2.2 Test with Dry-Run

```powershell
# Preview migration (safe)
./scripts/migration/migrate-files-safe.ps1

# Review output carefully:
# - All files accounted for?
# - Destinations make sense?
# - Purposes clear?
```

**Expected output:**
```
======================================================================
  📦 Safe File Migration Script

  📊 Migration Summary
======================================================================

Total files to migrate: 52
Skipped (not found): 0

This was a DRY RUN - no files were moved
```

#### 2.3 Create Structure Script (Optional)

```powershell
# create-structure.ps1
$directories = @(
    "docs/00-CURRENT",
    "docs/01-GUIDES",
    "docs/02-TECHNICAL",
    "docs/03-RUNBOOKS",
    "docs/05-ARCHIVE",
    "scripts/00-STARTUP",

    "scripts/04-BUILD",
    "scripts/05-DEPLOYMENT",
    "scripts/06-OPERATIONS",
    "scripts/07-UTILITIES"
)

foreach ($dir in $directories) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null
    Write-Host "✓ Created: $dir" -ForegroundColor Green
}
```

---

### Phase 3: Execution

#### 3.1 Final Team Review

```bash
# Generate review file
./scripts/migration/migrate-files-safe.ps1 > migration-plan.txt

# Share with team
# Wait for approval
```

```

#### 3.3 Update Import Paths

```bash
# Find broken imports
grep -r "\.\./" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Update systematically
# Old: ../../utils/helper.js
# New: ../../scripts/07-UTILITIES/helper.js
```

#### 3.4 Update Documentation

4. Document in commit message
```

#### 3.5 Test Everything

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Start application
npm start

# Test key workflows:
# - Startup works
# - Database connects
# - API responds
# - Build succeeds
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too many files, overwhelmed

**Solution:**
- Start with most painful area (docs OR scripts, not both)
- Do in phases over multiple days
- Get quick wins first

### Issue: Team doesn't agree on structure

**Solution:**
- Share the workflow and principles
- Discuss together
- Compromise on names
- Can always refine later

### Issue: Import paths break after migration

**Solution:**
- Use find/replace systematically
- Update one directory at a time
- Run tests after each batch
- IDE refactoring tools help

### Issue: Want to rollback

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Restore from backup
Copy-Item -Path "../repo-backup-20251019-140530\*" -Destination . -Recurse -Force

# Or use git
git checkout HEAD -- .
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Documentation
Docs are easier than code - get wins first.

### 2. Get Team Buy-In Early
Show them the workflow and principles before starting.

### 3. Test on a Branch
Create `refactor/repo-organization` branch first.

### 4. Document Everything
Add purposes to every file move in the script.

### 5. Leave Room for Growth
Use gaps in numbering (00, 02, 04 or 00, 10, 20).

### 6. Update Onboarding
Add structure explanation to onboarding docs.

### 7. Set Up Linting
Prevent files from going back to wrong places.
